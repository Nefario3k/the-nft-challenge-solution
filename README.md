## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learnt a lot of new styles with css attribues and properties. I also understood the default display types of different HTML selectors and how to use position styles in css. I was able to work with multiple classes without messing and reusing a class in a wrong html tag. Although my class naming needs more professionalism, I am quite happy I got this hands on experience.

### Continued development

Most of the styles used in styling this website felt really outdated to me as i didnt use any complex css for styles. I had issues with the positioning and I feel like the methods I used for rendering the position styles for the elemments was not very professional and not very responsive enough to various viewports.

### Useful resources
